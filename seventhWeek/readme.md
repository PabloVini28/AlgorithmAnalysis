# 🖥️ 👨‍🔬 Algorithm Analysis (PAA)

## Greedy Algorithms 💰
## 📌 Definition:
### A greedy algorithm builds a solution step by step, always choosing the option that looks best at the moment without considering future consequences. While not always optimal, greedy approaches are useful for certain problems.

## 🔍 Applications:
  - Huffman Coding (data compression).
  - Activity Selection (scheduling).
  - Fractional Knapsack Problem (resource allocation).
  - Prim’s & Kruskal’s MST Algorithms (graph problems).
## ⚡ Characteristics:
  - Greedy Choice Property – The locally optimal choice leads to a global optimum.
  - Optimal Substructure – A problem can be solved by solving subproblems optimally.
## ⏳ Time Complexity:
  - Typically O(n log n) due to sorting, but varies depending on the problem.
