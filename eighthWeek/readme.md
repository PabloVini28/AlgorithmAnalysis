## Dynamic Programming (DP) 🎭
## 📌 Definition:
### Dynamic Programming (DP) is a technique for solving problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing results to avoid redundant computations.

## 🔍 Applications:
  - Fibonacci Sequence – Using memoization to avoid recomputation.
  - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) – Used in DNA sequencing and text comparison.
  - 0/1 Knapsack Problem – Choosing the most valuable items without exceeding weight capacity.
  - Shortest Path (Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall) – Finding optimal routes.
## ⚡ Characteristics:
  - Optimal Substructure – The optimal solution is built from optimal subproblems.
  - Overlapping Subproblems – Results of smaller problems are reused.
## ⏳ Time Complexity:
  - Usually O(n²) or O(n³) but much more efficient than naive recursio
