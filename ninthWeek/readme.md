## NP-Complete Problems 🔥
## 📌 Definition:
### NP-Complete (NPC) problems are computational problems that are verifiable in polynomial time but have no known polynomial-time solution. These problems are central in computational complexity theory.

## 🔍 Applications:
  - Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) – Finding the shortest route visiting all cities exactly once.
  - Knapsack Problem – Maximizing profit while staying within weight constraints.
  - Graph Coloring – Assigning the minimum number of colors to a graph.
  - Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) – Determining if a boolean formula can be satisfied.
## ⚡ Complexity Classes:
  - P – Problems that can be solved in polynomial time.
  - NP – Problems where a solution can be verified in polynomial time.
  - NP-Complete (NPC) – The hardest problems in NP; if one NPC problem is solved in polynomial time, all NP problems can be solved in polynomial time.
  - NP-Hard – At least as hard as NPC problems but not necessarily in NP.
## 🔥 The P vs NP Question:
  - Does P = NP?
  - If P = NP, all NP problems could be solved in polynomial time, which would revolutionize computing.
  - If P ≠ NP, many optimization problems remain computationally hard.
## ⏳ Time Complexity:
  - Exponential (O(2ⁿ) or worse) for brute-force solutions.
